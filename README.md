Hi, I am Bruno Fontana da Silva.  
I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. My thesis was on the design _Sparse Code Multiple Access_ digital communication systems.  
Currently, I am taking courses on Machine Learning and _Natural Language Processing_ to develop new R&D projects in these fields.  
At the moment, I am also an assistant professor at [Instituto Federal Sul-rio-grandense (IFsul) - Campus Sapiranga](http://www.sapiranga.ifsul.edu.br/).
